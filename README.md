# AI-Driven Code Assistant: Project Overview

## Ultimate Goals

1. Create an AI-driven workflow to assist with coding tasks across multiple programming languages.
2. Enhance the language model's code generation capabilities, including innovative "moonshot" solutions.
3. Implement a system that can reason about, verify, and refine generated code.
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for developers to interact with the AI assistant.
5. Develop a self-improving system that learns from its outputs and user feedback.

## Workflow Overview

Our AI-driven code assistant follows a comprehensive workflow:

1. **Task Intake**: Receive a coding task from the user.
2. **Reasoning**: Create a high-level plan and list of requirements.
3. **Preparation**: Gather all necessary requirements for the coding stage.
4. **Context Building**: Compile information from code, git commits, and library documentation.
5. **Architecting**: Provide a high-level implementation plan, potentially with code examples and diagrams.
6. **Multi-Approach Coding**: Generate code using three distinct "personalities":
   - Moderate: Balanced approach
   - Creative: Innovative, "moonshot" solutions
   - Focused: Optimized, efficient code
7. **Testing**: Verify all implementations are functional.
8. **Synthesis**: Combine the best aspects of all three solutions.
9. **Final Testing**: Ensure the synthesized solution works correctly.
10. **Evaluation**: Assess the final code quality and effectiveness.
11. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Prepare the code for deployment.
12. **Self-Refinement**: Use insights from the process to improve future performance.
